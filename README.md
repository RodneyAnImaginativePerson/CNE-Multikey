# CNE Multikey

A mod for [Codename Engine](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine) that adds multikey support (1K - 9K).

This mod does not include multikey in the chart editor! This [fork](https://github.com/TheZoroForce240/CodenameEngine) here adds support for it inside the chart editor, but you will need to compile it yourself! (there is alternatively a build included with one of my [mods](https://gamebanana.com/mods/382037)) 

## Features
- 1-9K support, with a fully customizable xml to add and edit key counts
- Custom Controls
- Mid song key count changes
- Different key counts per strumline
- Gamepad and Mobile support

## How to use

Add a Set Key Count event and set the values, the first event in the song will be the default key count, and any afterwards will make it change mid song.
